description: 
  OddDotNet is an OpenTelemetry Test Harness that works for any language, built in .NET.
  It is a container image that accepts OpenTelemetry signals over gRPC (and soon HTTP),
  and it includes a query language for verifying and validating those signals.

  OddDotNet enables automated Observability Driven Development, hence where it gets its name.
